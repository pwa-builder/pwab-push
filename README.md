# pwab-push

`<pwab-push>` is a web component used in the main PWABuilder site for our push notification service. This component is not on NPM and is not meant to be used outside of the site.

## Notes Maintainers

- Run `npm run buildMonaco` once or after significant changes to monaco to simulate how the component integrates into PWABuilder
